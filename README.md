A web browser game designed using Javascript and HTML Canvas. All art and code was designed, written, and created by myself.

# About
For my Computer Science 11 Final Project, I was tasked to design a game with one restriction: The game had to feature a horse.

Using [W3Schools' tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp) as a starting point, I learned how to implement character movement and gravity. From there, I built the rest of the game myself. This was one of my first introductions to Object Oriented Programming and one of the first times I'd built a fully functioning program without guidance or supervision.
